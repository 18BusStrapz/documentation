# Additional Features and Settings
Believe it or not, this document simply scratches the surface of what the entire <a href="{{ links.website.home }}">Pieces for Developers</a> product lineup has to offer, and being just over a year into the journey, we're only getting started.
Nevertheless, here are some additional features and capabilities that are enabled with the Pieces for Developers | Desktop App.
 
## Connecting a Custom Cloud Domain
Sharing materials using Pieces for Developers is about more than sharing the material itself. It's about sharing the material and all the contextual metadata associated with it - where it came from, what it does, how to use it, associated people, and more. What's unique about our shareable links and sharing with Pieces for Developers is that all of our users receive their own, dedicated cloud, isolated from other users.

As a result, you can _personalize your cloud domain_ with a custom name, like _**https://mack.pieces.cloud**_. Now, when you generate and share a link, your link will include your personalized domain, so users know exactly who it came from.

_View this <a href="{{ links.snippets.python.snippet }}">Shared Python Snippet</a> from <a href="{{ links.snippets.python.collection }}">python.pieces.cloud</a> in your browser. Notice this is from the custom domain, "python"._

To personalize your cloud domain, open the <a href="{{ links.website.home }}">Pieces for Developers | Desktop App</a> and navigate to the settings menu.

**Important Note:** Updating your personal cloud domain can take up to 15 minutes. Don't worry, we will notify you when this is complete.
