# Additional Features and Settings
Believe it or not, this document simply scratches the surface of what the entire <a href="{{ links.website.home }}">Pieces for Developers</a> product lineup has to offer, and being just over a year into the journey, we're only getting started.
Nevertheless, here are some additional features and capabilities that are enabled with the Pieces for Developers | Desktop App.

## Editing saved Code Snippets and Text Notes
As we progress deeper into our projects, frameworks and dependencies often change, which means we might need to adjust a saved snippet to comply with breaking changes or conform to new standards. Click on the pencil in the upper-right corner of the Pieces Desktop App to quickly and easily edit a saved snippet so your code can stay relevant and up-to-date.

## Renaming Saved Materials
We're on a mission to make it as frictionless as possible for our users to save snippets without disrupting their flow. The AI in Pieces for Developers will attempt to add a relevant name for your snippets automatically, so you don't have to. Don't worry, you can rename your snippets anytime to a convention that works best for you. All you need to do is right-click a snippet in the List View and select "Rename".

## Reclassifying a Code Snippet's Language Association
When you save a material to Pieces for Developers, our AI works hard to understand what you saved so that we can successfully add as much helpful metadata - tags, related links & websites, related people, etc. - as possible.

One of our fundamental capabilities is Instant Language Detection, which automatically detects the language of your snippet and supports over 40 programming languages, including Typescript, Javascript, Python, Dart, C++, C#, and many more. Unfortunately, we don't always get it right, so we made it as easy as possible to reclassify a snippet to the proper language. Simply right-click a snippet in the List View and select "Reclassify".

## Deleting a Saved Material
Since we made it so simple to save snippets from the <a href="{{ links.extensions.chrome }}">browser</a>, your IDE, or with our <a href="{{ links.website.pfd_desktop_install }}">Flagship Desktop App</a>, users are saving hundreds of snippets throughout their time researching, coding, and collaborating. For some, this can get a little chaotic. If you find yourself looking to do a little spring cleaning, you can delete snippets by hitting your delete key.

## Connecting a Custom Cloud Domain
Sharing materials using Pieces for Developers is about more than sharing the material itself. It's about sharing the material and all the contextual metadata associated with it - where it came from, what it does, how to use it, associated people, and more. What's unique about our shareable links and sharing with Pieces for Developers is that all of our users receive their own, dedicated cloud, isolated from other users.

As a result, you can _personalize your cloud domain_ with a custom name, like _**https://mack.pieces.cloud**_. Now, when you generate and share a link, your link will include your personalized domain, so users know exactly who it came from.

_View this <a href="{{ links.snippets.python.snippet }}">Shared Python Snippet</a> from <a href="{{ links.snippets.python.collection }}">python.pieces.cloud</a> in your browser. Notice this is from the custom domain, "python"._

To personalize your cloud domain, open the <a href="{{ links.website.home }}">Pieces for Developers | Desktop App</a> and navigate to the settings menu.

**Important Note:** Updating your personal cloud domain can take up to 15 minutes. Don't worry, we will notify you when this is complete.
