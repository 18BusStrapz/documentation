### Troubleshooting the Pieces buttons
There are a few reasons why the Pieces buttons may not be appearing:

1. **Pieces OS isn’t running.**
    - To double-check that Pieces OS is running, make sure that the Pieces logo is present in your toolbar (on MacOS) or your task bar (on Windows). If it isn’t there, please launch Pieces OS by clicking Pieces OS in your Applications folder.
    > If you need to download and install Pieces OS, please <a href="{{ links.website.home}}">visit this link</a>.

2. **That website is on your “Filter Out” list.**
    - Double-check that you haven’t added this site to your Filter Out list by navigating to the extension settings. If you remove the site from the Filter Out list, just refresh the page and the buttons should appear.

3. **This website doesn’t have detectable code**
    - The code on this site might be embedded in an iframe, or it might be rendered in a way we haven’t encountered before! Please send us the site in this feedback form and we’ll work on supporting it.
