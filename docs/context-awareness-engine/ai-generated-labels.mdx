# AI-Generated Smart Labels and User-Added Tags
Doubling down on our efforts to make search and suggestion world-class, Pieces for Developers ships with an offline and on-device ML Material Labeling model that automatically generates smart labels for everything you save.

_e.g., “HTTP Request”, “Flutter Framework”, "Dart Project", "Conditional For Loop"_

## User Added Tags
In addition to our auto-generated smart labels, our Context Awareness Engine automatically layers in tags that correspond to origin details and related links.

> You can easily add your own tags as a manual way to further organize your saved resources while driving a more personalized search and suggestion experience.
