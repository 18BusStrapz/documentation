- ### AI-Generated Smart Descriptions and Associated Commit Messages
#### Our users are saving more than ever. That said, a large part of our material enrichment efforts are allocated towards making searches and suggestions first-class.
#### With these end goals in mind, Pieces for Developers ships with an offline and on-device ML Material Description model that generates a smart description for everything you save:
  - **e.g., What the code snippet or resource is, what it does, how to use it, and how it might be used in the future.**

   > These smart descriptions, coupled with relevant commit messages extracted via our Context Awareness Engine, enable awesome reference and reuse experiences later on in a user's workflow.
