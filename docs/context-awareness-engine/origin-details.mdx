### Origin Details
When you save something to <a href="{{ links.website.home }}">Pieces for Developers</a>, it not only saves the material itself; but further, our Context Awareness Engine and Origin Details** automatically attach related context & metadata, enabling powerful organization, search, and suggestion capabilities.

**Reference code is everywhere these days. Whether it's a solution that you're adapting from Stack Overflow or doc-site boilerplate sent over Slack or Microsoft Teams, all code comes from somewhere.**

Where a code snippet came from and the larger context it was taken out of is often lost when saving or sharing reference materials, making it incredibly difficult to find, share, or reuse it later on.
In an effort to maintain this invaluable context, Pieces for Developers automatically extracts and associates useful origin details every time you save a resource.
- e.g., Project Name, Source File, Line Numbers, Collaborators, Solution Publishers, Application Source, etc.
