These days, technical work is more people-centric than ever. Writing and reviewing code, upskilling on ever-evolving best practices, migrating to new framework versions, and onboarding new developersâ€” it all builds on the work of others.

It's a challenge simply to know who to reach out to for additional context, who to add as a reviewer on pull requests, or who might provide a different perspective to save some serious time and prevent major headaches.

To help solve this dilemma, our Context Awareness Engine automatically associates Relevant Collaborators, Maintainers, and Content Authors with the resources you save.
