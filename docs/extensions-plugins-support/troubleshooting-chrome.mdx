### Where are my saved snippets stored?
> _The <a href="{{ links.installation.pfd_desktop_install }}">Pieces Suite</a> must be downloaded and installed separately from the Chrome Extension in order for the extension to work properly._

- When you save code snippets with Pieces, they are stored locally in the Pieces desktop app.
- When you save a snippet, Pieces also saves metadata such as the origin of the snippet, tags, a title, a description and more.

To view and reuse your snippets, just open the Pieces desktop app and scroll through the carousel.

### What does the share button do?
When you click the Share button below a code block, Pieces generates a link that is specifically designed to share useful code with its context— it’s automatically copied to your clipboard once it’s generated.

This means that instead of copying code and pasting it into a message, you can create a Pieces link that shares the code and maintains formatting, syntax highlighting and relevant tags.
> The recipient will also get the title, description, related links and other context about the snippet.

### Troubleshooting the Pieces buttons
There are a few reasons why the Pieces buttons may not be appearing:

1. **Pieces OS isn’t running.**
    - To double-check that Pieces OS is running, make sure that the Pieces logo is present in your toolbar (on MacOS) or your task bar (on Windows). If it isn’t there, please launch Pieces OS by clicking Pieces OS in your Applications folder.
    > If you need to download and install Pieces OS, please <a href="{{ links.website.home }}">visit this link</a>.

2. **That website is on your “Filter Out” list.**
    - Double-check that you haven’t added this site to your Filter Out list by navigating to the extension settings. If you remove the site from the Filter Out list, just refresh the page and the buttons should appear.

3. **This website doesn’t have detectable code**
    - The code on this site might be embedded in an iframe, or it might be rendered in a way we haven’t encountered before! Please send us the site in this feedback form and we’ll work on supporting it.

If none of the above fix your issue, please <a href="{{ links.socials.support }}">send us an email</a> and we’ll get back to you!

### How do I remove the Pieces buttons from a site?
If you don’t want the Pieces buttons to appear on a certain website, you can add it to your personal “Filter Out” list in the extension settings.

1. Right-click the Pieces icon in the top right corner of your browser and choose “Options”
2. Navigate to the “Filter Out” window and add the URL of the site you wish to exclude in the proper field. Click “Save Filter,” and the Pieces buttons will not be displayed on that website the next time you visit it (you’ll need to refresh your current page for this to take effect).

**Definitely!**
