To view and reuse your snippets, just open the <a href="{{ links.website.home }}">Pieces desktop app</a> and scroll through the carousel.

## Edit my snippets in IntelliJ
Editing a snippet is super easy and can be done right inside Intellij without having to open a separate window. When you edit a new tab will open where you can adjust the contents of your code snippet.

To open and edit a previously saved snippet:
1. Select the snippet in the Pieces tool window
2. Hit Alt+Enter (⌥⏎ on macOS) or right-click and select “Edit…” from the pop-up menu
3. Make your changes
4. Save the snippet using Ctrl+S (⌘S on macOS)
 > Additionally, you can adjust your snippets name, description, and classification from inside of this right-click

## Viewing my Saved Snippets in Intellij
There are a few ways to view your full list of code snippets inside your IDE.
- Right Click context menu:
    1. Right click inside Intellij
    2. Find "My Saved Pieces" inside the context menu that comes up
    3. When you hover "My Saved Pieces", a pop out window will open on the side of the context menu, showing you a full list of all of your saved code snippets.

    2. Select the Icon and a new sidebar viewer should open, with all of your snippets listed in a view seperated based on language

## Using Suggested Save in JetBrains
Pieces can intelligently identify and save snippets based on re-use patterns in your JetBrains workflow. Whenever Pieces saves a snippet, you'll see a "Saved a Piece!" confirmation in the bottom right of your screen. Your snippet is now saved in Pieces with a default name and automatically classified by language.
