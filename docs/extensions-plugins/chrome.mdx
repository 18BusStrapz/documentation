Using the Pieces Chrome Extension with the Pieces Desktop App makes saving code easy from anywhere you interact with code on the web.

## Installing the Extension
**Note:** In order to save code with the Pieces Chrome Extension, you must have <a target="blank" href="{{ links.website.pfd_desktop_intall }}">Pieces OS and the Pieces for Developers desktop app.</a> 

To add the extension to Google Chrome, visit our listing on <a target="blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pieces-save-code-snippets/igbgibhbfonhmjlechmeefimncpekepm"> the Chrome Web Store.</a>

Once you've added it to Chrome, refresh your browser and you'll see the Pieces buttons appear below code blocks on the web.

## Where are my Saved Snippets stored?
_The <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.website.pfd_desktop_install }}">Pieces Suite</a> must be downloaded and installed separately from the Chrome Extension in order for the extension to work properly._

- When you save code snippets with Pieces, they are stored locally in the Pieces desktop app.
- When you save a snippet, Pieces also saves metadata such as the origin of the snippet, tags, a title, a description, and more.

To view and reuse your snippets, just open the Pieces desktop app and scroll through the snippet list or gallery.

## What Does the Share Button Do?

![The Pieces Chrome Extension shows the button that creates a sharable link.](/assets/chrome_share_button.png)

When you click the Share button below a code block, Pieces generates a link that is specifically designed to share useful code with its context— it's automatically copied to your clipboard once it's generated.

This means that instead of copying code and pasting it into a message, you can create a Pieces link that shares the code and maintains formatting, syntax highlighting, and relevant tags. The recipient will also get the title, description, related links, and other context about the snippet.

## Why aren't the Pieces Buttons appearing?
There are a few reasons why the Pieces buttons may not be appearing:

1. **Pieces OS isn't running.**
 - To double-check that Pieces OS is running, make sure that the Pieces logo is present in your toolbar (on macOS) or your task bar (on Windows). If it isn't there, please launch Pieces OS by clicking Pieces OS in your Applications folder.
 - If you need to download and install Pieces OS, please <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/overview">visit this link</a>.

2. **You disabled the Pieces buttons on that website.**
 - Double-check that you haven't disabled the Pieces buttons from this site by navigating to the extension settings. If you enable the Pieces buttons, the page will automatically refresh and the buttons should appear.
