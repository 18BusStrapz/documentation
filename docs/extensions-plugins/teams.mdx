## Overview

Pieces for Microsoft Teams makes sharing code with your teammates 10x easier, and makes that code 10x more useful. By saving and enriching code directly from teams, you can capture more context, like who sent you code and the conversation surrounding it.

üö®üöÄBefore diving in, please note that an active Pieces for Developers account is required to access and utilize all the features of Pieces for Microsoft Teams. Make sure to use the same email to login to Pieces and your Microsoft Teams account to establish the connection between the applications.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please reach out to our dedicated [Support team](mailto:support@pieces.app), or [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/getpieces). We will be more than happy to provide you with the necessary details and address any issues.

### Getting Started & Saving a Snippet from Teams

1. Install Pieces for Personal Use
    - It‚Äôs important to download and [install Pieces OS and the Pieces Desktop App](https://pieces.app/). Create an account or sign in with the email you use for Microsoft Teams. This will allow you to connect Pieces and Teams.
2. Install Pieces for Microsoft Teams
    - Install the [Pieces Microsoft Teams bot for personal use](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/789f23b3-d882-45ca-b3a3-de7f850656ea?source=app-details-dialog) and select from the dropdown to add the bot to specific teams, chats, or meetings. Return here to add the bot to additional teams and chats later!
    - Once you have downloaded the bot, restart Pieces OS to ensure the connection with Teams.
3. To enable the Pieces App in Teams, type ‚Äúlogin‚Äù in the message window with the Pieces Bot. If prompted to refresh your access token please type ‚Äúlogout‚Äù and then ‚Äúlogin‚Äù once more.
4. Save Code Snippets & Messages from Teams
    - Select the desired message and perform the "Save to Pieces" action or use the ‚Äú@Pieces Save‚Äù command to save the previous message to Pieces.
    - Saved snippets will be visible in the Pieces for Developers Desktop App and enriched with titles, tags, descriptions, related links, and more!

### Features

Please make sure your Pieces OS is updated to the latest version; you need to be on version 4.2.3 or newer to access all of these capabilities in Teams. Remember: Make sure you‚Äôre signed in to Teams and Pieces using the same email to connect the two apps.

#### Authenticate with Pieces

Authenticate the Pieces Chat Bot by typing ‚Äúlogin‚Äù in your chat window with Pieces. This command gives the bot permission to perform actions on your Chats and Teams messages. Once you log in, make sure your Pieces OS is running and you can get started!

Real-time synchronization occurs when logged in to Pieces with the same email used for Microsoft Teams.

Want to enable the bot in multiple Chats and Teams? Simply return to the app store listing and add Pieces to the desired Chat or Team to enable the bot.

#### @Pieces Save

Saving a snippet to Pieces can be done in two easy ways:

1. Save to Pieces by typing the action below the desired message.
2. Select **More Options > More Actions** on the desired message and select the **Save to Pieces** action.

Both actions save the message or code attachments to Pieces for Developers where they are automatically enriched with valuable metadata.

#### @Pieces Discover

Have you tried Snippet Discovery in the Pieces Desktop App? Try this message command to experience that magic in Teams. Pieces will comb through your desired chat or team, identify messages with code, and save them to the Pieces Desktop App.

#### @Pieces Enrich

This command will select the previous message (assuming it‚Äôs a code snippet) and enrich it with AI-powered metadata, like related links, related people, titles, language classifications, and more! It‚Äôs a simple way to learn more about your code without leaving Teams.

#### @Pieces Extract

If you‚Äôve just sent an image that contains code, this command is for you. It will select the previous message, extract code from the image with our code-specific OCR, and enrich the extracted code with the same AI-powered metadata as above. While this command only works with image files, it‚Äôs still an incredibly powerful function in Teams.

#### @Pieces Unfurl

If you‚Äôve sent a Pieces-generated shareable link, this command will unfurl it and display the code within a chat or channel with a convenient save button that will capture additional Microsoft Teams context.

#### @Pieces Help & @Pieces Hi

Need a little help with Pieces for Microsoft Teams? Both the ‚ÄòHelp‚Äù & ‚ÄòHi‚Äù commands will provide you with useful notes, links, and a list of all the available tips and commands to help resolve any issues.

**Note: All message commands skip messages that include @Pieces commands and messages from the Pieces bot. This enables you to retry a message command if a failure occurs.**

### Where are my saved snippets stored?

_The <a href="{{ links.installation.pieces_suite_manager }}">Pieces Suite</a> must be downloaded and installed separately from the Microsoft Teams App in order for the extension to work properly._

When you save code snippets with Pieces, they are stored locally in the Pieces desktop app.

When you save a snippet, Pieces also saves metadata such as the origin of the snippet, tags, a title, a description, and more.

To view and reuse your snippets, just open the Pieces Desktop App!
