## Installing the Pieces for Developers VS Code Extension
**Note:** In order to use the Pieces VS Code Extension, you must have <a target="blank" href="/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing">Pieces OS.</a> We recommend also using the Pieces for Developers desktop app.

You can install the VS Code Extension through the <a target="blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.pieces-vscode">VS Code Marketplace</a> or by searching for Pieces in the plugins search of your IDE. 

Once you've installed the extension, you'll have to restart VS Code before using Pieces.

## Save snippets with Pieces for VS Code
To save code to Pieces from VS Code, simply highlight the snippet and save with:
1. Keyboard Shortcut
 
 Windows: ```Shift + CTRL + V```
 
 MacOS: ```Shift + CMD + V```

2. Right Click
 
 Right-click and select "Save to Pieces"

## View Saved Snippets
To view your full list of code snippets inside your IDE:

  2. Select the Pieces Icon and a sidebar viewer will open with all of your snippets in a language-based list

  You can expand the list of snippets for each language by clicking on the name of the language.

### Preview Saved Snippets in Markdown
If you'd like to get a closer look at a snippet before adding it to your project, click on the snippet in the list view and it will open in a Markdown preview. You'll be able to see the snippet and its context, including any tags, descriptions, titles, related links, related people, and previously generated shareable links.

## Refresh your Saved Snippets
Sometimes, when saving new snippets from other plugins and extensions, you'll have to refresh your VS Code extension to get a fully updated snippet list. To refresh the list, click the refresh button located at the top of the Pieces Explorer.

## Suggested Materials

In the Pieces VS Code Extension list view, check out the Suggested Materials section. The snippets displayed here are relevant to your current file so that you can add them to your project with less searching. Pieces aims to show you the exact snippet you need precisely when you need it— and our suggestions will only get better the more you use it!

## Explored Materials & Snippet Insights

Exploring Materials with Pieces Insights allows you to learn more about a code snippet without saving it to your repository.

To Explore a material:

1. Highlight a code snippet in your editor
2. Right-click and select “Explore with Pieces Insights” or hit [Shift+Alt+E] (Windows)/[Shift+Option+E] (MacOS)
3. Click the “View Insights” success message in the lower right corner of your editor
4. Pieces will open a new window with a markdown file that showcases your snippet, its description, and other associated metadata.

To revisit explored materials, visit the section titled “Explored Materials & Snippet Insights” in the Extension Tree View. Here, you can view your explored materials, save them to Pieces, or delete them— just right-click.

If you'd like to automatically save your explored materials to your Pieces repository, toggle on “Explore and Save” in your extension settings.

**Note:** In order to Explore Materials, you must be connected to your Pieces Cloud.

## Related Materials to Current Selection

Pieces can discover related snippets to the code in your editor, even if you're curious about code that isn't a Pieces snippet. To find related materials: 

1. Highlight some code in your editor
2. Right-click and select “Find Related Materials in Pieces” 
3. Pieces will search your saved snippets and display any related materials in the Side Panel so that you can easily add them to your project.

## Connect Account

From this section of the sidebar, you can connect to (and disconnect from) your Pieces account without opening the Pieces for Developers desktop app. You'll need to be connected to your Pieces account in order to generate shareable links and explore materials.
