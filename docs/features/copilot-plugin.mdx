# Pieces Copilot (Plugins/Integrations)

## Your personalized copilot, across all your favorite integrations

Our VS Code, Jetbrains, Obsidian, and Jupyter Lab integrations all offer the same copilot chat features, ensuring a consistently powerful experience wherever you need it.

## Features
1. **Chat with any of your materials, anywhere**
    - You can use files, folders, and snippets as context in order to ask the copilot about them.
