# Creation and Generation
From inside of Pieces for Developers, we make it simple to add materials as you find them, but sometimes the best solution is written or generated code, instead of a more general solution.

Utilizing the power of ChatGPT, in-house models, and other strategies employed by the Pieces team, you can generate and create new snippets based off others that you have saved.

## Describe a Snippet
Use natural language to fully describe code that will assist you in your project or a small snippet that you only need once from the "Describe a Snippet" menu. You can access this menu by:
1. Get to the "Describe a Snippet" Overlay:
    - Selecting the "Add +" button that is underneath of the carousel
    - Pressing ```CMD + Shift + P / CTRL + Shift + P``` will open the overlay immediately

2. After the menu opens, you can begin typing in the search bar marked with a ">". Here is an example phrase for you to try:
    ```
    split a string based on spaces and print each item
    ```
    **Before pressing enter - be sure to set the language to the output language that you would like to get back. This will be set based on the last snippet that you were focused on in your carousel automatically unless you set it yourself.**

3. After generation completes, you will see the snippet in the language that you selected below it. You can save this snippet after you generate it, or you can change the language that the snippet was generated with and re-run the generation again.
