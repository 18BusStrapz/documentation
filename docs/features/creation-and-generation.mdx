# Creation and Generation
From inside of Pieces for Developers, we make it simple to add materials as you find them, but sometimes the best solution is written or generated code, instead of a more general solution.

Utilizing the power of ChatGPT, in-house models, and other strategies employed by the Pieces team, you can generate and create new snippets based off others that you have saved.

## Create Code from a Description
Use natural language to fully describe code that will assist you in your project or a small snippet that you only need once from the "Describe a Snippet" menu. You can access this menu by:
1. Opening the "Describe a Snippet" Overlay:
    - Selecting the "Add +" button that is underneath of the carousel
    - Pressing ```CMD + Shift + P / CTRL + Shift + P``` will open the overlay immediately

2. After the menu opens, you can begin typing in the search bar marked with a ">". Here is an example phrase for you to try: ```> split a string based on spaces and print each item```

    **Before pressing enter - be sure to set the language to the output language that you would like to get back. This will be set based on the last snippet that you were focused on in your carousel automatically unless you set it yourself.**

3. After generation completes, you will see the snippet in the language that you selected below it. You can save this snippet after you generate it, or you can change the language that the snippet was generated with and re-run the generation again.

## Discover Related Snippets
Based on the snippets that you save and use daily, Pieces for Developers will help you discover other related code snippets that are useful to you. Using semantic information, context, and usage - the snippets that you may be looking for can show up here.

You can now discover related code snippets to the snippet you're currently focused on. Using advanced AI, we generate these snippets based on the tags, links, and descriptions of existing snippets. Please note that this feature is not available for Images.

#### Discovering Related Snippets inside of Pieces for Developers:
1. From the Carousel - select the pill that says "Discover Related" located right underneath of your current material
    > Sometimes discovering related snippets can take 10 - 15 seconds, as it evaluates the snippets that you have saved and finds other relatable materials.

2. Once discovery completes, you can select from the snippets presented to you here - navigate these using your arrow keys or by hovering and pressing the arrows that reveal themselves.

3. Hit Save in the top right and any selected snippets will be added into Pieces for Developers for the future!

While we continue to improve the prompts, we recognize that results may be mixed at times. We're committed to making this feature as helpful as possible, and we're excited for you to try it out!
