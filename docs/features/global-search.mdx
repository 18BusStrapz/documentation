# Global Search

<Image zoom alt={"Using Global Search in the Pieces desktop app"} src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pfd_wiki/GLOBAL_SEARCH.gif" />

Global search allows you to [search for code semantically](#) to help you find something you may not know how to find. You can use whole sentences like "functions that transform arrays", or "flutter widgets that are stateful" to get code snippets related to the problem that you are trying to solve.

_If you are looking for more information about our Search types that can be toggled on the List or Gallery View - [go here](#)._

## How to Use Global Search
To access Global Search in the Pieces desktop app, select Global Search from the dropdown menu in the upper left corner where other views like [Workflow Activity](#), [Snippet Discovery](#), and more.

Once you arrive at the [Global Search View](#), you can start to type into the search bar located at the top of the app. You can either press ```/``` to toggle into the search bar, or click to select it.

This is the Global Search Bar - which is where you will type the semantic search terms to find what you are looking for.

Some other helpful information:
- You can press ```esc``` 2x to clear the search bar
- You can press ```esc``` (when the search bar is not focused) to navigate back to the list view or gallery view, depending on which you came from

### Using Search Queries
The queries here are limitless, but learning to craft the **right search** is important. Here are a few examples that we use every day and the types of snippets that are returned:

| Query | Result(s)  | Explaination  |
|---|---|---|
| csv file reader | Python Parse Data CSV, Importing Country Data | Python Parse Data CSV is self explainatory, but the description on 'Importing County Data' states it "loads a csv file from a URL and prints the first 5 rows. |
| firebase deploy | Firebase Hosting Deployment with GitHub Actions | Related to 'deploying a firebase app' this user uses github frequently. |
| promise helper | Promise Resolution Helper Function | Smart Tagged with 'Future' and description talks about sync |
| js sleep function | CommonJS Conversion Function, Promise-based Sleep Function | Generated title match, code lannguage match, CommonJS related match |

## Suggested Searches
While there are a number of custom queries that you could type in every time, why would you? When you are on the Global Search View, you can see a list of search queries generated **specific to the code you save**.

_To get a new set of suggested searches, simply press the "refresh" icon next to "Suggested Searches" above the pills._

### Understanding Search Results
When you perform a search, you will have three main sections that will show up pertaining to the query.
1. The snippets that match your results will be in vertical cards containing:
    - The Title of the Snippet
    - The Description of the Snippet
    - An "Expand Code" dropdown to see a specific snippets code/text contents
    - A [Productivity Score](#)
    - (optional) a related link to the source that the resource came from i.e. saved using the [Chrome Extension](#)

2. Related tags between the results that you have:
    - Each tag that can be seen is included on one of the results, and can be clicked on to see which snippet they are connected to

3. Related Links
    - The related links across the search results that you have
        - Searching using a description such as "building widgets in flutter", then using the related links results to research about a topic is a great way to utilize this feature. Learn more about [searching and researching inside Pieces Desktop](#)
