# Managing Saved Materials

## Learning How to Update and Edit
Once you save a material you can edit the snippets visible features - its title, and the contents of the resource itself. Access these features by clicking the `pencil icon` that is at the top of the Quick Action Menu on the right side of your Pieces Desktop window.

You can do one of two things here:
- By clicking in where the code is in the center of the screen, you can edit the snippet directly
- You can access transformations that can create boilerplate code and add comments for you. [Read about Snippet Transformations to know more](#)

### Editing saved Code Snippets and Text Notes Directly
Once you select the code in the center of Pieces Desktop you have freedom to manipulate the text/code however you see fit with functionality similar to that of your IDE.

- Your code syntax highlighting will update as you edit to ensure you are using valid syntax while making adjustments
- You can right-click to cut, copy, paste, and select all

To Exit edit mode, you can press `esc` or select the 'Exit Edit Mode' pill, and you will be taken back to the [list](#) or [gallery](#) view.

## Renaming Saved Materials

Before working with renaming snippets, be sure to read about our [AI title generation](#) to get an idea of how title generation takes place.

To rename a snippet quickly, press ` cmd/ctrl + R ` to toggle the title's 'Edit Mode'. You'll notice the title becomes highlighted, and you can begin typing immediately.

## Reclassifying a Code Snippet's Language Association

<Image alt={"Reclassifying a snippet in the Pieces desktop app."} zoom src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pfd_wiki/RECLASSIFY_IN_PFD.gif" />

Each snippet that is added to Pieces passes through our language models to **classify the snippet for you if you do not already know the language**. Our classifier is not 100% accurate as it learns about each user. Some things to note before diving in:

1. The classifier learns based on the code you save to Pieces, so if you only save Javascript Snippets this will increase the bias of Pieces to support that language.
2. Inside the [Reclassification Drawer](#) you can see the classification confidence, which is a guide to help you select the relevant language for the code snippet when it is pasted. By reclassifying code when it is auto-classified as the wrong language to the correct language, tells your local model to _note_ the change that you made for the future, making it more likely to classify it correctly next time.

### Instant Language Detection Support
One of our fundamental capabilities is Instant Language Detection, which automatically detects the language of your snippet and supports over 40 programming languages:

## Deleting a Saved Material

<Image alt={"Deleting a snippet in the Pieces desktop app."} zoom src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pfd_wiki/DELETE_SNIPPET.gif" />

Just as quickly as you add, you can remove snippets as well. To delete a resource you can simply press `delete`, or you can follow these steps:

In list View:
- Select the Snippet that you would like to delete
- Select the ` ... ` on the bottom of the Quick Action Menu
- Scroll to the bottom of the Context Menu, and once you get to the bottom of the drawer, you will see a section labeled "Danger Zone"
- Select the "Delete Piece" Icon (you can also press `delete` from here as well)
- A new drawer will confirm your choice to delete the resource
- You can click "Delete" or press `enter` to confirm
    - Please keep in mind that at this time, Pieces cannot retrieve a deleted resource
    - You can also choose “Don’t ask me again” to turn off the confirmation window
