# One-click Snippet Sharing
Pieces snippet sharing allows you to send someone a code snippet and its context connected to a link that you generate inside of Pieces Desktop or one of our extensions.

Effortlessly share code snippets, screenshots, and other resources with a personalized access link (e.g., _YOUR_USERNAME.pieces.cloud_), in just a few steps.

## Getting Started with Sharing
_Before getting started with snippet sharing, you will need to make sure that you are [signed in]() that way we can create space for your private cloud._

1. After signing in and ensuring that you are [connected to the cloud](#), go to any snippet inside the desktop application
2. Once you have the snippet selected, press the "Sharable Link" icon on the Action menu nested on the right side of your screen.

3. This will open up the "Shareable Link Drawer" that will have a few different possibilities:
    - The link should already be present if you are connect to the cloud, or a spinner will be there with a message reading "Generating your sharable link"
        - This process is normally only about 10 seconds (maximum)
    - "Connect to cloud" will be present if your cloud connection did not complete automatically, but you can click the cloud icon to connect - [find out more about troubleshooting Cloud Connectivity](#)
    - if you are _still_ not signed in, you can do this from here and the text box will read "Connect your Account"

Simply click the **_Save to Pieces_** button located at the top of the <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.internal.personalized_link_sharing.single_click_link_sharing }}">Sharing Preview Web App</a>, and you're good to go! You can now access and reuse the locally saved resource in our **Flagship Desktop App** or in your IDE with the <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.extensions.vscode }}">Pieces for Developers | VSCode Extension</a> or <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.extensions.jetbrains }}">Pieces for Developers | Jetbrains Plugin</a>.

## Editing and Revoking Shared Snippets

If you edit the resource or add additional context metadata, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/overview">Pieces for Developers</a> will either recommend that you update the link or automatically update it for you. This happens in the background without generating a new access link, meaning previous recipients can stay up-to-date and you don't have to re-share.

Lastly, we know that accidental shares happen and permission levels can change. With that, you can always revoke a shareable link at any time.

## Share via GitHub Gist

When creating a shareable link to a snippet, you can also choose to share the snippet via GitHub Gist by creating the Gist directly from Pieces.

Created Gists be available on your list of public Gists, making them available for others to discover as you create them. (You can also choose to generate a Private Gist.)

### Bundled Metadata Preview
Every Gist has a _Markdown Preview_ built using our <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.internal.context_awareness_engine.origin_details }}">Context Awareness Engine and Origin Details</a> which include relevant and related information to the snippet's context.

## Connecting a Custom Cloud Domain

Sharing materials using Pieces for Developers is about more than sharing the material itself. It's about sharing the material and all the contextual metadata associated with it - where it came from, what it does, how to use it, associated people, and more. What's unique about our shareable links and sharing with Pieces for Developers is that all of our users receive their own, dedicated cloud, isolated from other users.

As a result, you can _personalize your cloud domain_ with a custom name, like **https://YOUR_USERNAME.pieces.cloud**. Now, when you generate and share a link, your link will include your personalized domain, so users know exactly who it came from.

_View this <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.snippets.python.snippet }}">Shared Python Snippet</a> from <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.snippets.python.collection }}">python.pieces.cloud</a> in your browser. Notice this is from the custom domain, "python"._

To personalize your cloud domain, open the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/overview">Pieces for Developers | Desktop App</a> and navigate to the settings menu.

**Important Note:** Updating your personal cloud domain can take up to 15 minutes. Don't worry, we'll notify you when this is complete.
