# Pieces Copilot
Describe and chat about your code with Pieces Copilot. You can write out a sentence and Pieces' ML models will generate functional code to use inside your project.

## Getting Started With Pieces Copilot
Navigate to the ` Copilot & Global Search ` view from the dropdown, and you will see the Copilot chat box towards the bottom of the app window. If you're looking for more information about Global Search, [you can find more details here](https://code.pieces.app/features/global-search).

You can start chatting with the Pieces Copilot with a few different actions:

1. Paste code into the chat box, and the Copilot will let you know if there are any issues.
    - Try pasting this code snippet:
        ```javascript
        function build(){
            console.log("build starting");
            let _count;
            for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
                _count = _cocunt + 1;
                console.log($_count);
            }
            console.log('counted to ten!');
        }
      ```
      - The Pieces Copilot will identify, explain, and correct a couple of errors. 
2. Ask a technical question, and the Copilot will answer it. 
    - Here are a few examples to try:
        - ` How do I create a flexible div with 8px of padding on both sides? `
        - ` Loop over a directory of files and write the first line of their contents to a new text file. `
3. Drag and Drop a screenshot of code, and the Pieces Copilot will extract the code, explain it, and answer questions about it.
    - Pressing ` Scan Screenshot ` allows you to select a screenshot from your file picker to add.
    - Read about dragging and dropping code into Pieces desktop on the [Saving Screenshots Page](https://docs.pieces.app/product-hihglights-and-benefits/saving-screenshots).
