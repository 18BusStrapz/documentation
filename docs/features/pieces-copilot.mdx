# Pieces Copilot
Describe code and chat with Piece copilot about your code. You can write out a sentence and Pieces ML powered models will give you back functional code to use inside your project.

## Getting Started With Pieces Copilot
Open up the ` Copilot & Global Search ` view from the dropdown, and you will see the copilot chat box towards the bottom of the app window. IF you are looking for more information about Global Search [go here](https://code.pieces.app/features/global-search) and read the details on that page.

You can start with three different actions:

1. Paste code into the chat-box
    - for example, we will use this code snippet:
        ```javascript
        function build(){
            console.log("build starting");
            let _count;
            for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
                _count = _cocunt + 1;
                console.log($_count);
            }
            console.log('counted to ten!');
        }
      ```
2. Ask a technical question
    - Here are a few examples:
        - ` How do I create a flexible div with 8px of padding on both sides `
        - ` Loop over a directory of files and write the first line of their contents to a new text file `
3. Drag and Drop a screenshot of code
    - Read about dragging and dropping code into Pieces desktop on the [Saving Screenshots Page](https://docs.pieces.app/product-hihglights-and-benefits/saving-screenshots)
4. Pressing ` Scan Screenshot ` allows you to select a screenshot from your file picker to add.

### Results from Copilot
Once you start at any of the above points you will get data back from copilot. Here are the results from the examples we started above:

#### Pasted Javascript Snippet
After pasting the above [Javascript Snippet](#getting-started-with-pieces-copilot) you can see the response from Pieces Copilot has done a few things. Here is the response from Pieces Copilot:

```text
I noticed that there are a few errors in the code you provided:

1. There's a typo in the variable name `_cocunt`, it should be `_count`.
2. There's an extra dollar sign in the console.log statement.
3. The loop currently counts up to 11, not 10.

Here's an updated version of your function that should work as intended:
```

Following the helpful message explaining the issues with the code I pasted into the chat, my code has been corrected and given back to me cleaned with the errors that were listed already implemented in my code.

```javascript
    function build() {
        console.log("build starting");

        let _count = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            _count = _count + 1;
            console.log(_count);
        }

        console.log('counted to ten!');
}
```
