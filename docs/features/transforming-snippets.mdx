# Transforming Snippets

Snippets are sometimes very close to the format you need, or they would be better utilized as boilerplate for different applications. With transformations, you can save even more time while coding. Transformations can convert languages, improve code readability and performance, and create boilerplate templates.

| Quick action menu with transform icons |

## Getting Started with Snippet Transformations
In order to access the snippet transformations, first you need to [save your first code snippet](#). Once you have code inside of Pieces Desktop:
1. Use ` cmd/ctrl + e `Press **Edit this snippet** which will open up the [Edit Mode View](#) and will change the icons on the Quick Action Menu

2. Each of the icons here represent a different transformation style:
    - **[Modify Snippet for Boilerplate Usage](#)
        - you can transform a code snippet into a boilerplate template in seconds, complete with any notes as code comments! This makes it extremely easy to make your code even more reusable.
    - [Modify Snippet for Improved Performance](#)
        - re-write a code snippet in its current language to be more performant
    - [Modify Snippet to Improve Readability & Understanding](#)
    - [Transform or Translate a Snippet with a Description](#)
        - Can turn one language into another
        - (optional) takes a description that can additionally transform the snippet

3. Once you perform any of the transformations, you will have a few options on how to complete the transformations process. You choose any of the following:
    - Save and Exit
    - Save as Duplicate
    - Discard and Exit
    - Undo Changes

4. Once you select a specific transformation on a snippet, Pieces will keep track of it and mark the transform icon with a green checkmark if you have already performed that specific transformation.

_Our Transformations are currently in Beta - please <a target="_blank" href="https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF">share any feedback</a> so that we can continue to make them more useful!_

## Modify for Boilerplate
With our new feature,

## Improve Readability
Learning a new programming language? With just two clicks, you can edit your code snippets to be more human-readable. This makes it much easier to understand how a code snippet works, and is useful for developers of all experience levels.

## Improve Performance
Pieces can now re-write a code snippet in its current language to be more performant. This means better code in less time! It's a huge time-saver for you.

## Transform or Translate with a Description
Now you can convert any code snippet to a new language supported by Pieces, without any manual rewriting! This feature is incredibly useful if you work on multiple projects that use different programming languages, or if you find a solution to a problem in a language that's different from what you're looking for.

After converting a code snippet, you can save it as an update to your existing snippet, or discard the changes.
