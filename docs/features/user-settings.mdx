## Acounts & Cloud Integrations - Signing In With an Account
There are a number of accounts that you may already have that you can use to sign in to Pieces Desktop. **Don't forget that when you sign in here, you will be signed in to the same account for any plugins you have installed.**

To sign in select ` Connect Accounts ` and then follow the steps that apply to you:

    1. Select the Microsoft Logo on the right side of the drawer
    2. A dialog will open that shows you how to sign in once you press continue.
        - Watch the Gif to get an understanding of the process.
    3. Then select ` sign up `, and create an account using your Microsoft email address. It will look something like ` username@domain.onmicrosoft.com `.
    4. Then create a password for your account that is being added/created, and press enter once you meet the requirements in the dropdown.
    5. Select "Accept" to create your account, and you will be redirected back into the application

- Connecting with a GitHub Account
    1. Select the GitHub logo on the right side of the drawer
    2. On the ` auth.pieces.services ` page, select 'Continue with GitHub'
    3. Be sure to be signed in to GitHub
    4. Then select ` link this account ` on the following screen
    5. You will then be redirected back into the application

    2. On the ` auth.pieces.services ` page, select 'Continue with Google'
    3. Then select the Google account that you would like to use, sign in, and you should be redirected to a confirmation login page.

    3. Then enter your password and press continue, where you will be redirected to a successful log in screen
        - You can also select ` Sign up ` to create an account if you have not before and unlock features like [Snippet Sharing](https://docs.pieces.app/features/one-click-snippet-sharing)

You will be redirected back into the application, and should now see your email at the top of the drawer. You can see your cloud starting to connect and create your first cloud instance on your account. Note this may take a few seconds to connect, and learn about your personal cloud to see what you can do.

### Connecting Multiple Accounts
You can connect more than one account (i.e. GitHub and Google ) to Pieces to do things like [Importing Gists from GitHub](https://docs.pieces.app/product-highlights-and-benefits/import-gists-from-github). When doing this there are a few things to look out for:

- Make sure that the primary email on all connected accounts are the same, as it can cause issues between authentication and publishing Gists to the right location
- Once you sign in with multiple accounts, any time you sign in again you will be signed in with all of your connected accounts, not just one.

## Private Cloud (beta)
When you first sign in, your cloud will start to connect automatically. Other times your cloud may be connected, or disconnected depending on your internet connection. Make sure you have a stable internet connection when connecting to the cloud.

Here are a few of the states your cloud may be in:

| Status | Meaning | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Connected | Your Cloud is successfully connected and can be used. | Green |
| Connecting | Attemting to connect to your Cloud, and depending on the stability of your connection can take 10s - 15s | Yellow |
| Disconnected | No internet connection can be made to your Pieces Cloud. | Red |

### Personal Domain
You can read about your personal cloud domain and sharable links [here around One Click Snippet Sharing](https://docs.pieces.app/features/one-click-snippet-sharing).

## Layout
During onboarding, you can **select your default layout** and set it as either List View, or as Gallery View. In your settings you can adjust this value from what it was initially set as, and also adjust other default settings with how each of these is sorted.

_The default setting is what will be set when the application loads but can still be changed on the go via the ` View Dropdown ` on either view_

### Default Layout
When loading the application it will default to one of the two followng settings based on your choice:

**List View**
The list style view with a list of your snippets on the left that can be scrolled through vertically for easy navigation with your mouse or up and down arrow keys.

**Gallery View**
A visual carousel style that allows you to view more of your code and navigate horizontally with your left and right arrow keys.

### Default List View & Gallery View Sort
For each view there is a default sort which effects the order that your snippets are presented to you. Both of the settings are the same options, but effect each view independently. That way you can customize both to your specific liking.

The Available settings are:
- **Recent**
    - Will show all of your snippets in chronological order, ` newest --> oldest `
- **Suggested**
    - Uses Pieces' ML models to suggest the most useful snippets for you ` based on language, usage, and other factors `.
- **Alphabetical**
    - Sorts all snippets based on title from ` A --> Z `
- **Language**
    - Sorts all of your current snippets ` based on language in alphabetical order `.
    - Note that all of your snippets will still be in a flat list.

## Aesthetics
You can control the visual aspects of the application to adjust Light Mode and Dark Mode, along with minor adjustments to the scale of the application.

### Toggle Light Mode

**Shortcut:** ` ⌘/CTRL + SHIFT + T `
