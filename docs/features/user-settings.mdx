        - You can also select ` Sign up ` to create an account if you have not before and unlock features like [Snippet Sharing](https://docs.pieces.app/features/one-click-snippet-sharing)

You will be redirected back into the application, and should now see your email at the top of the drawer. You can see your cloud starting to connect and create your first cloud instance on your account. Note this may take a few seconds to connect, and learn about your personal cloud to see what you can do.

### Connecting Multiple Accounts
You can connect more than one account (i.e. GitHub and Google ) to Pieces to do things like [Importing Gists from GitHub](https://docs.pieces.app/product-highlights-and-benefits/import-gists-from-github). When doing this there are a few things to look out for:

- Make sure that the primary email on all connected accounts are the same, as it can cause issues between authentication and publishing Gists to the right location
- Once you sign in with multiple accounts, any time you sign in again you will be signed in with all of your connected accounts, not just one.

## Private Cloud (beta)
When you first sign in, your cloud will start to connect automatically. Other times your cloud may be connected, or disconnected depending on your internet connection. Make sure you have a stable internet connection when connecting to the cloud.

Here are a few of the states your cloud may be in:

| Status | Meaning | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Connected | Your Cloud is successfully connected and can be used. | Green |
| Connecting | Attemting to connect to your Cloud, and depending on the stability of your connection can take 10s - 15s | Yellow |
| Disconnected | No internet connection can be made to your Pieces Cloud. | Red |

### Personal Domain
You can read about your personal cloud domain and sharable links [here around One Click Snippet Sharing](https://docs.pieces.app/features/one-click-snippet-sharing).

## Layout
During onboarding, you can **select your default layout** and set it as either List View, or as Gallery View. In your settings you can adjust this value from what it was initially set as, and also adjust other default settings with how each of these is sorted.

_The default setting is what will be set when the application loads but can still be changed on the go via the ` View Dropdown ` on either view_

### Default Layout
When loading the application it will default to one of the two followng settings based on your choice:

**List View**
The list style view with a list of your snippets on the left that can be scrolled through vertically for easy navigation with your mouse or up and down arrow keys.

**Gallery View**
A visual carousel style that allows you to view more of your code and navigate horizontally with your left and right arrow keys.

### Default List View & Gallery View Sort
For each view there is a default sort which effects the order that your snippets are presented to you. Both of the settings are the same options, but effect each view independently. That way you can customize both to your specific liking.

The Available settings are:
- **Recent**
    - Will show all of your snippets in chronological order, ` newest --> oldest `
- **Suggested**
    - Uses Pieces' ML models to suggest the most useful snippets for you ` based on language, usage, and other factors `.
- **Alphabetical**
    - Sorts all snippets based on title from ` A --> Z `
- **Language**
    - Sorts all of your current snippets ` based on language in alphabetical order `.
    - Note that all of your snippets will still be in a flat list.

## Aesthetics
You can control the visual aspects of the application to adjust Light Mode and Dark Mode, along with minor adjustments to the scale of the application.

### Toggle Light Mode

**Shortcut:** ` ⌘/CTRL + SHIFT + T `

You can change your theme from most locations and views inside of Pieces Desktop app - _but not all of them_. If your hear a ` boop ` or get no reaction when attempting to adjust the theme **try closing the dialog or drawer that you have open** or open your settings and adjust the theme by pressing the ` Theme Toggle Icon ` on the right side of the settings drawer.

### Zoom In/Zoom Out

**Shortcut:** ` ⌘/CTRL + ` or ` ⌘/CTRL - `

To increase or decrease the font size of the application if you need to see more or less code on the screen or get up close with a specific line of text.

## Support
When you need assistance, more documentation, or want to see a full list of keyboard shortcuts you can select one of these icons. You can also pull these up from many locations throughout the app using their shortcuts.

### Support Center

**Shortcut:** ` ⌘/CTRL + ? `

Opens [Pieces Documentation Center](https://docs.pieces.app) (Yes - that's where we are now) in case you need assistance or are looking for something

### Submit Feedback

**Shortcut:** ` SHIFT + ! `

If you want to leave feedback on the application or are having some form of bug/issue, fill out this form, and we will be in touch.

### Check for Updates

**Shortcut:** ` SHIFT + U `

You will normally get a notification as soon as an update is available from the Pieces team, but you can also check for updates here. If updates are available you will be propted to update, and if not you will recieve a notificiation that you are ` currently up to date `.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Shortcut:** ` ⌘/CTRL + ; `

You can open up a file with all the keyboard shortcuts available in the application, even if you are offline with no connection to the internet.

[//]: # (TODO: You can also view the keyboard shortcuts we have available here.)

### Launch Onboarding
If you need to go back to onboarding to adjust your user persona, or code languages that you use, you can go back through onboarding by pressing the ` redo ` icon on the right side of the drawer.

## In-App Notifications
When saving a snippet, copying a snippet, and performing other actions inside of Pieces Desktop you will notice different notification messages you receive to confirm the action as completed. There are three base settings you can set here:

**None**: Shows no in-app notifications while using snippets or adjusting data

**Critical**: Shows important messages but very minimal notifications will show

**All**: Will show all notifications including confirmations of copy, paste, duplications, etc.

## Customize
There are a few specific settings that are good to know but require a bit more explanation.

### Default Search Modes
We offer a number of search modes for users in the Pieces Desktop App that change the way you can get search results back. Each has its own benefits for rediscovering your code and understanding the way each works can make selecting the right one for you easier.

_Note that you can always change these settings on the go when searching by selecting the dropdown next to the ` search hourglass icon `_

#### ` Blended `
Blended takes advantage of all aspects of your code snippets, and is the **default** setting for Pieces Desktop. When this is set, you can use search in a traditional way, as you would with other search engines

#### ` Full Text Search (FTS) `
Full Text Search uses your text to directly match with text found on a code snippet that you have saved. This matches specific characters but not semantic meaning such as the following example:

| Search | Snippet | Match? |
|---|---|---|
| batch | cd batchfile.md | Yes |
| batch | cd copyfiles.bat | No |

#### ` Neural Code Search (NCS) `
Neural Code Search takes advantage of semantic description and allows you use the meaning to find what you are looking for. Take the above example - where you search for a batchfile and type ` batch ` and notice how the results are now opposite:

| Search | Snippet | Match? |
|---|---|---|
| batch | cd batchfile.md | No |
| batch | cd copyfiles.bat | Yes |

Because when using NCS you would be **searching for a snippet that cds into a batchfile**.

#### ` Search With Snippet `
Using Search with Snippet allows you to search other related snippet by pasting a code snippet into search, and you will get back search results of code snippets that are related inside your Pieces Desktop Storage.

### Confirmation Settings
When deleting snippets and managing sharable links, there are a few notifications that appear to confirm slightly sensitive deletions around tags, or updating sharable links when content has changed. The drawer that opens when you select the cog inside your settings has a number of options.

#### Confirm Piece Deletions
By defualt when deleting snippets by pressing ` Delete ` or from the context drawer, you will get a confirmation message to delete a snippet permantly. If you would like to turn this setting off and hide the confirmation messges, you can select the checkbox here.

#### Confirm Context Deletions
When removing tags, related links, related people, and sensitives you may want to remove a large number at once. To hide this notification you can select ` All ` or select the individual items that you would like to be notified about before deletion.

#### Updates
Changing data on [sharable links](https://docs.pieces.app/feaures/one-click-snippet-sharing) causes them to update, and if you want to hide the notifications that appear asking you ` if you would like to update your sharable link with new context ` just select the checkbox here.

There is a second checkbox specific to code snippets that contain sensitive information and if you would like to be prompted.

### Metrics Summary Settings
When in the Gallery View Mode you can see a context menu preview that will appear while navigating left and right through your code snippets.

You can adjust if it will automatically show for snippets that are small and will take a hybrid split view in the carousel.

#### Visibility
This controls how often the metrics preview will show, whether it is ` All ` which will leave it visible always, ` Navigating `, showing it only when navigating left and right in the carousel but hiding it soon after stopping on a single snippet, or ` Hovering `, only showing when you hover the context icon on the bottom right of the code snippet in the gallery view.

You may combine these three settings to create the best experience for yourself.

## Processing
You can select to use local or cloud processing to manage your code snippets depending on your environment. Using local models have shown increases in speed with minor trade-offs. **Blended** mode utilizes both local and cloud models and gains additional benefits such as qGPT processing.

Try both modes to find what works best in your environment.

## Telemetry
You can always adjust the amount of anonymous data that you share with us, and by unchecking this box we will not collect data and analytics from your machine. Regardless of collection prefereces here we do not collect your code snippets as they are store anonymously. The data we collect helps us see how often particular buttons are pressed, and what sections of the application are used the least by the community as a while, so we can provide a better experience for you. Any personal data is not collected and your code is not shared with any other parties, even when shared.
