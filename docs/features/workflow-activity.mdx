# Workflow Activity Stream

Picking up where you left off and getting back into flow is one of the largest productivity bottlenecks in a developer's workflow. So, our team has been hard at work making it easier than ever to backtrack through your work-in-progress journey.

Our **Workflow Activity Stream and Process Backtracking** enables you to quickly find and access useful context metadata that's been associated with your saved materials.

## Workflow Details
Workflow details and points of reference such as <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.internal.context_awareness_engine.related_links_resources }}">related links</a>, <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.internal.personalized_link_sharing.single_click_link_sharing }}">shared snippets</a>, <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.internal.context_awareness_engine.tags }}">relevant tags</a>, <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.internal.context_awareness_engine.related_people }}">collaborators</a>, and more are all available as a scrollable timeline in our Desktop Application.

## Workflow Activity Search & Filters
In the Workflow Activity view, you can search to quickly find a specific event in your workflow even more quickly. You can search for events related to creation, references, and more by tying in <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.internal.context_awareness_engine.origin_details }}">context details</a> to narrow down the search.

When navigating and utilizing powerful snippets, Workflow Activity can get filled up fast! Use **Search Filters** to narrow down your search to a specific type.

### Created:
These events are oriented around creating a snippet from any location, such as saving a snippet from the <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.extensions.chrome }}">Pieces Chrome Extension</a>, or saving from one of your favorite IDEs like <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.extensions.jetbrains }}">JetBrains</a> or <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.extensions.vscode }}">VS Code</a>.

### Updated:
Each updated event comes from adding to or removing content in the snippet itself or from any changes to the metadata in the Information View.

### Deleted:
Deleted events pertain to removing an entire snippet/asset from Pieces for Developers - from any location.

### Referenced:
Reference events take place in the background and are attributed to a snippet when you view it for some time.

_As your view time on snippets goes up, the algorithm will balance itself out to lower unwanted or unnecessary events._
