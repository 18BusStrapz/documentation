# Sorting by Realtime or Scope-Relevant Suggestions
The demands on developers are increasing every day. As a result, a developer's time is becoming ever more precious and anything that boosts productivity is no longer a nice-to-have, but a need-to-have.

With that, our team has invested serious resources into enabling Pieces for Developers to proactively suggest the most relevant materials at the right time.

We're excited to for you to check out **Sorting via Suggestions**, which is based on your recently saved materials, available in our <a href="{{ links.website.pfd_desktop_install }}">Flagship Desktop App</a>.
