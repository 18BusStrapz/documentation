- ### Sorting with Realtime and Scope-Relevant Suggestions
#### The demands on developers are increasing every day. As a result, a developer's time is becoming ever more precious and anything that boosts productivity is no longer a nice-to-have, but a need-to-have.
#### With that, our team has invested serious resources enabling Pieces for Developers to proactively suggest the most relevant materials at the right time.
#### We're excited to for you to check out **Sorting via Suggestions**, which is based on your recently saved materials, available in our **[Flagship Desktop App]**.
