### Pick up where you left off with the Workflow Activity Stream
Picking up where you left off and getting back into flow is one of the largest productivity bottlenecks in a developer's workflow. So, our team has been hard at work making it easier than ever to backtrack through your work-in-progress journey.
- Our **Workflow Activity Stream and Process Backtracking** enable you to quickly find and access useful context metadata that's been associated with your saved materials.

Workflow details and points of reference such as <a href="{{ links.internal.context_awareness_engine.related_links_resources }}">related links</a>, <a href="{{ links.internal.personalized_link_sharing }}">shared snippets</a>, <a href="{{ links.internal.context_awareness_engine.ai_generated_labels }}">relevant tags</a>, <a href="{{ links.internal.context_awareness_engine.related_people }}">collaborators</a>, and more are all available as a scrollable timeline right within our <a href="{{ links.website.pfd_desktop_install }}">Flagship Desktop App</a>.
