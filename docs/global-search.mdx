- ### Adjusting Settings for Optimal Search Results
#### Search semantically by looking for what a Piece accomplishes or search by text matching to find specific variable names or sections of different saved materials:
- **Blended search**: Search via multiple query matches, including code, tags, descriptions, and links, to find the information you need. This method can be particularly useful for users who need to search for specific information across a variety of sources.
- **Full-Text Search**: Search for text values within code, documents, and other text-based sources. This method is particularly useful for users who are looking for specific words or phrases.
- **Neural Code Search**: Search by describing what you're looking for using natural language. This method can be particularly useful for users who are not familiar with the specific terminology used in code or who are looking for a more intuitive way to search for information.

- ### Sorting with Realtime and Scope-Relevant Suggestions
  #### The demands on developers are increasing every day. As a result, a developer's time is becoming ever more precious and anything that boosts productivity is no longer a nice-to-have, but a need-to-have.
  #### With that, our team has invested serious resources enabling Pieces for Developers to proactively suggest the most relevant materials at the right time.
  #### We're excited to for you to check out **Sorting via Suggestions**, which is based on your recently saved materials, available in our **[Flagship Desktop App]**.

- ### Pick up where you left off with the Workflow Activity Stream
  #### Picking up where you left off and getting back into flow is one of the largest productivity bottlenecks in a developer's workflow. So, our team has been hard at work making it easier than ever to backtrack through your work-in-progress journey.
  #### Our **[Workflow Activity Stream and Process Backtracking]** enable you to quickly find and access useful context metadata that's been associated with your saved materials. Workflow details and points of reference such as related links, shared snippets, relevant tags, collaborators, and more are all available as a scrollable timeline right within our **[Flagship Desktop App]**.
