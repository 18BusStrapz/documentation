# What is Pieces OS?

Pieces OS operates as a background service, functioning both offline and on-device, facilitating communication among individual products within the Pieces for Developers suite. Its core functions include the management of local, private, and secure machine learning models used for [Pieces Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/features/pieces-copilot), as well as [real-time search](gttps://docs.pieces.app/features/search-modes) and suggestions.

Serving as a helper service, Pieces OS enables Pieces products to operate 100% locally on your machine, with an option to connect to the cloud for [backup](https://docs.pieces.app/features/back-up-and-restore), synchronization, and [sharing](https://docs.pieces.app/features/one-click-snippet-sharing) purposes.
