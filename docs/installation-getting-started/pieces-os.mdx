# What is Pieces OS?

Pieces OS operates as a background service, functioning both offline and on-device, facilitating communication among individual products within the Pieces for Developers suite. Its core functions include the management of local, private, and secure machine learning models, as well as real-time search and suggestions.

Serving as a helper service, Pieces OS enables Pieces products to operate 100% locally on your machine, with an option to connect to the cloud for backup, synchronization, and sharing purposes.

[Could be good to include some non-secret architecture diagram here.]
