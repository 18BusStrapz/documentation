## Adjust Settings for Optimal Search Results
Pieces for Developers offers three ways to search within the Desktop App in order to quickly find what you need.

### Blended Search
- Search via multiple query matches, including code, tags, descriptions, and links. This method can be particularly useful for users who need to search for specific information across a variety of sources.

### Full-Text Search
- Search for text values within code, documents, and other text-based sources. This method is particularly useful for users who are looking for specific words or phrases.

### Neural Code Search
- Search by describing what you're looking for using natural language. This method can be particularly useful for users who are not familiar with the specific terminology used in code or who are looking for a more intuitive way to search for information.

The demands on developers are increasing every day. As a result, a developer's time is becoming ever more precious and anything that boosts productivity is no longer a nice-to-have, but a need-to-have.

With that, our team has invested serious resources into enabling Pieces for Developers to proactively suggest the most relevant materials at the right time.
