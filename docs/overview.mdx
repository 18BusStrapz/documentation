# Overview

In 2022, our team set out on a journey to build the most advanced code snippet management and workflow context platform yet.

The debut release of our Flagship Desktop App aimed to take developer _productivity to the next level_ by incorporating key capabilities and our users' favorite features directly into their IDE.

Effortlessly save, enrich, search, share, reference, and reuse code snippets, workflow context, and other useful developer resources.
