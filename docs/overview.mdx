# Overview

In 2022, our team set out on a journey to build **_the most advanced code snippet management and workflow context platform_** yet.

The debut release of our <a href="{{ links.website.home }}">Flagship Desktop App</a> aimed to take developer _productivity to the next level_ by incorporating key capabilities and our users' _favorite features directly into their IDE_.

**Effortlessly save, enrich, search, share, reference, and reuse code snippets, workflow context, and other useful developer resources.**
