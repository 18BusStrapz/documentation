ink-Sharing of Saved Materials and Their Context Metadata
#### Developers, Technical Writers, Instructors, and many others in the space constantly share code snippets, error logs, configuration files, boilerplate, sample code, and other developer materials with their colleagues, readers, students, open-source maintainers, customers, and so on.
#### For us, sharing is not only about sending someone the code snippet or resource itself, but further, enabling the recipient to access both the material and its associated context metadata - where it came from, what it is, why it was saved, its description, git context, tags, additional collaborators, related links, and so much more.
     

- ### Single-click Link Sharing
#### Effortlessly share code snippets, screenshots, and other resources with a personalized access link _e.g.,_ **_YOUR_USERNAME.pieces.cloud_**_,_ in just a few steps. When you select a resource and generate a shareable link, that resource, along with all of its useful context, is uploaded to your private Pieces for Developers Cloud.
#### From there, those with the link will be able to access what you shared and its context metadata, even if the recipient doesn't have Pieces for Developers themselves.
- **Preview this [Shared Python Snippet] from [python.pieces.cloud] in your browser, which is one of twenty useful snippets in our _[Curated Python Snippets Collection]_**
#### Further, if you edit the resource or add additional context metadata, [Pieces for Developers] will recommend that you update the link or automatically update it for you. This happens in the background without generating a new access link, meaning previous recipients can stay up-to-date and you don't have to re-share.
#### Lastly, we know that accidental shares happen and permission levels can change. With that, you can always revoke a shareable link at any time.

- ### Saving a Shared Material for Offline Reuse from the Pieces for Developers âŽ¸ Sharing Preview Web App
#### Although it's not necessary to have [Pieces for Developers] when accessing a shared resource, we don't want our users to have to switch back and forth to the browser or keep track of all the shareable links you've received.
#### Recipients that have [Pieces for Developers] can easily save a copy of the shared resource to their own [Pieces for Developers] drive for offline search, suggestion, and reuse later on.
#### Simply click the **_Save to Pieces_** button located at the top of the Sharing Preview Web App, and you're good to go! You can now access and reuse the locally saved resource in our [Flagship Desktop App] or in of your IDE with the [Pieces for Developers | VSCode Extension] or [Pieces for Developers | Jetbrains Plugin].

- ### Share via GitHub Gist
#### When creating a shareable link to a snippet, you can also choose to share the snippet via GitHub Gist and create the Gist directly from Pieces.
#### Gists that are created will be available on your list of public Gists, making them available for others to discover once you create them.
> Every Gist has a _Markdown Preview_ built using our [Context Awareness Engine and Origin Details] which include relevant and related information to the context the Piece came from.
