### Saving a Shared Material for Offline Reuse from the Pieces for Developers ‚é∏ Sharing Preview Web App
#### Although it's not necessary to have <a href="{{ links.website.home }}">Pieces for Developers</a> when accessing a shared resource, we don't want our users to have to switch back and forth to the browser or keep track of all the shareable links you've received.
#### Recipients that have <a href="{{ links.website.home }}">Pieces for Developers</a> can easily save a copy of the shared resource to their own **Pieces for Developers** drive for offline search, suggestion, and reuse later on.
#### Simply click the **_Save to Pieces_** button located at the top of the <a href="{{ links.internal.personalized_link_sharing.single_click_link_sharing }}">Sharing Preview Web App</a>, and you're good to go! You can now access and reuse the locally saved resource in our **Flagship Desktop App** or in of your IDE with the <a href="{{ links.extensions.vscode }}">Pieces for Developers | VSCode Extension</a> or <a href="{{ links.website.jetbrains }}">Pieces for Developers | Jetbrains Plugin</a>.
