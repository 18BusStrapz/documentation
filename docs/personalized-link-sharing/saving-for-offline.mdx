- ### Saving a Shared Material for Offline Reuse from the Pieces for Developers ‚é∏ Sharing Preview Web App
#### Although it's not necessary to have [Pieces for Developers] when accessing a shared resource, we don't want our users to have to switch back and forth to the browser or keep track of all the shareable links you've received.
#### Recipients that have [Pieces for Developers] can easily save a copy of the shared resource to their own [Pieces for Developers] drive for offline search, suggestion, and reuse later on.
#### Simply click the **_Save to Pieces_** button located at the top of the Sharing Preview Web App, and you're good to go! You can now access and reuse the locally saved resource in our [Flagship Desktop App] or in of your IDE with the [Pieces for Developers | VSCode Extension] or [Pieces for Developers | Jetbrains Plugin].
