### Share via GitHub Gist
#### When creating a shareable link to a snippet, you can also choose to share the snippet via GitHub Gist and create the Gist directly from Pieces.
#### Gists that are created will be available on your list of public Gists, making them available for others to discover once you create them.
> Every Gist has a _Markdown Preview_ built using our <a href="{{ links.internal.context_awareness_engine.origin_details }}">Context Awareness Engine and Origin Details</a> which include relevant and related information to the context the Piece came from.
