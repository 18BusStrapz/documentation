# Share via GitHub Gist
When creating a shareable link to a snippet, you can also choose to share the snippet via GitHub Gist by creating the Gist directly from Pieces.

Gists that are created will be available on your list of public Gists, making them available for others to discover as you create them. (You can also choose to generate a Private Gist.)

## Bundled Metadata Preview
Every Gist has a _Markdown Preview_ built using our <a href="{{ links.internal.context_awareness_engine.origin_details }}">Context Awareness Engine and Origin Details</a> which include relevant and related information to the snippet's context.
