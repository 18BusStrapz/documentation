### Single-click Link Sharing

Developers, Technical Writers, Instructors, and many others in the space constantly share code snippets, error logs, configuration files, boilerplate, sample code, and other developer materials with their colleagues, readers, students, open-source maintainers, customers, and so on.For us, sharing is not only about sending someone the code snippet or resource itself, but further, enabling the recipient to access both the material and its associated context metadata - where it came from, what it is, why it was saved, its description, git context, tags, additional collaborators, related links, and so much more.
Effortlessly share code snippets, screenshots, and other resources with a personalized access link (e.g., **_YOUR_USERNAME.pieces.cloud_**), in just a few steps. When you select a resource and generate a shareable link, that resource, along with all of its useful context, is uploaded to your private Pieces for Developers Cloud.

From there, those with the link will be able to access what you shared and its context metadata, even if the recipient doesn't have Pieces for Developers themselves.
> Preview this <a href="{{ links.snippets.python.snippet }}">Shared Python Snippet</a> from _python.pieces.cloud_ in your browser, which is one of twenty useful snippets in our <a href="{{ links.snippets.python.collection }}">Curated Python Snippets Collection</a>

Further, if you edit the resource or add additional context metadata, <a href="{{ links.website.home }}">Pieces for Developers</a> will recommend that you update the link or automatically update it for you. This happens in the background without generating a new access link, meaning previous recipients can stay up-to-date, and you don't have to re-share.
Lastly, we know that accidental shares happen and permission levels can change. With that, you can always revoke a shareable link at any time.
