## Saving Useful Developer Materials

Pieces for Developers was built from the ground up to serve as a centralized place to save all types of materials and resources related to a developer's work-in-progress journey.
Code snippets, scratch files,  screenshots, UML diagrams, links, and more. Paste something from your clipboard, drag & drop, or save it directly in IDE via our plugins.

- ### Stay in Flow with Effortless Save
  We are making a continuous effort to provide our users with frictionless ways to save key workflow materials. Stay in flow with our **[Flagship Desktop App]** and simply copy a code snippet or other resource and paste it in Pieces. You can also drag images, files, and more directly into the desktop app. Save all types of resources. It's better to have a resource available and not need it than need it and not have it!
  > - e.g., Boilerplate/Reference Snippets, Common Bash/Powershell Commands, CI/CD Configurations, HTTP Requests, Screenshots, Architecture/UML Diagrams, Text Notes, and so much more.

- ### In-Project Snippet Discovery
  **[Pieces for Developers]** is the first developer tool in the world to ingest an entire code base and return hyper-specific, highly-reusable code snippets entirely offline and on-device.
  Running **[Snippet Discovery]** on a local source repository has huge benefits:
    - Discover highly reusable snippets, resulting in less time spent re-writing the same code from scratch over and over
    - Driving code standardization within and across projects
    - Discover reference snippets and share them with your team or use them to onboard new developers faster than ever

- ### Import Gists from GitHub
  Import saved code from GitHub and discover other users' Gists from inside the Pieces for Developers | Desktop App. When you import Gists, Pieces attaches metadata from its original repo along with PRs, related people, and additional context.

      > You may be wondering if you can **create Gists** - read more about [Creating Gists from the Desktop App]

- ### Saving Screenshots and Optical Code Recognition
  To save an image or screenshot, you can either drag the image directly into the [Flagship Desktop App] window or you can _upload a file_ by clicking the "Add +" button above the icons in the carousel.
    - Any file type that Pieces for Developers supports can be dragged or copied into the desktop app. Simply drag the file over the Pieces Desktop App and a green plus will appear. Drop the file into the application window; it will be added to the repo immediately.
      > If your file is too large, you can compress the image via the notification that appears when you release your mouse click.
