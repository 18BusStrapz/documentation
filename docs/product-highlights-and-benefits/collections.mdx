# Snippet Collections
Collections are a group of generic examples of code based on a language, that can be used as templates to get started on a language. We have created these collections ourselves and have attached metadata to each snippet with addition resources to learn about how it works, the ins and outs and where it came from.

_You can grab a snippet from a collection, then duplicate it to use it as a template for later and that you can use to reference again._

## Where do I get Collections?
To find collections you can go to a few places:

1. Collections inside of Pieces Desktop
    - To get to collections, press ` cmd + shift + c ` or `ctrl + shift +  c` and a new dialog will open. You can also press the `add snippets +` button on either view, then select the collection or collections you want. You can add them all at once by pressing the plus button on each language specific card. Here is an example of one of the cards:

    ![](/assets/nodejs_collection_card.png)
2. Collections on https://code.pieces.app/collections
    - Go the URL above, then select the language you want. Pressing `Add to Pieces` will allow you to add the entire collection, or you can press  `explore` to select individual snippets from the list if you only want to select 1 or 2.

## Collections We Currently Provide
The number of completed collections is currently only 6, but each stack has a slightly different number of snippets included. All current collections that we support and offer are as follows:

| Collection Language | Snippets |
|---|---|
| Typescript | 16 Snippets |
| SQL | 26 Snippets |
| Dart | 16 Snippets |
| Python | 18 Snippets |
| Node.js | 20 Snippets |
|  Javascript | 17 Snippets |

### Managing Download Collections
First Note is that once you select a collection language and press save, the _only way_ to get these out is to delete them all individually. We are looking to upgrade this feature in the future but for new it will exist as is.

If you select multiple collections to download, each of the collections that you downloaded will actually be added as well, but the process may take a little longer.
