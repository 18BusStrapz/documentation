# Connecting to a Remote Pieces OS Instance

Through multiple user support tickets, we have noticed that many of our users are using the Pieces for Developers VS Code extension in a remote development environment.

This guide will walk you through how to connect to a remote Pieces OS instance using the Pieces for Developers VS Code extension.

> - This is currently only available for the Pieces for Developers VS Code extension. Functionality for the rest of the Pieces for Developers ecosystem is coming soon.

## Use Cases

- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)
- [SSH connection](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh)
- [Development Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)

## Prerequisites

- 1 machine with [Pieces OS](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) installed
- 1 machine with the [Pieces for Developers VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piecesapp.pieces) installed

## Using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)

For WSL users, you can access Pieces OS installed on your local Windows machine by setting up a port forward to make it accessible within WSL.

  ]}

  <TabItem value="static-url">
    1. Install ngrok on the machine with Pieces OS if it isn’t already
    2. Run the following command on your machine’s terminal: ```ngrok http --domain=STATIC_URL_HERE 1000```
    3. Copy the forwarding URL it generates to use in the next step
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value={"generated-url"}>
