# Connecting to a Remote Pieces OS Instance

This guide will walk you through how to connect to a remote Pieces OS instance using the Pieces for Developers VS Code extension.

> - This is currently only available for the Pieces for Developers VS Code extension. Functionality for the rest of the Pieces for Developers ecosystem is coming soon.

## Use Cases

- Remote development environments (e.g. [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), etc.)

## Prerequisites

- 1 machine with [Pieces OS](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) installed
- 1 machine with the [Pieces for Developers VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piecesapp.pieces) installed
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) installed on the machine with Pieces OS

## Setting up your ngrok tunnel

We recommend using a static ngrok URL which you can claim by following [this guide](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/free-static-domains-ngrok-users).

<Tabs
  defaultValue={"static-url"}
  values={[
    {label: 'Static URL', value: 'static-url'},
    {label: 'Generated URL', value: 'generated-url'},
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="static-url">
    1. Install ngrok on the machine with Pieces OS if it isn’t already
    2. Run the following command on your machine’s terminal: ```ngrok http --domain=STATIC_URL_HERE 1000```
    3. Copy the forwarding URL it generates to use in the next step
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value={"generated-url"}>
    1. Install ngrok on the machine with Pieces OS if it isn’t already
    2. Run the following command on your machine’s terminal: ```ngrok http 1000```
    3. Copy the forwarding URL it generates to use in the next step
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
