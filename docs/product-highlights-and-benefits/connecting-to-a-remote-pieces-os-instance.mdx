## Prerequisites

- 2 machines with [Pieces OS](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) installed
- [Pieces VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piecesapp.pieces) installed
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) installed on the machine with Pieces OS

## Setting up your ngrok tunnel

We recommend using a static ngrok URL which you can generate by following [this guide](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/free-static-domains-ngrok-users).

<Tabs
  defaultValue={"windows"}
  values={[
    {label: 'Generated URL', value: 'generated-url'},
    {label: 'Static URL', value: 'static-url'},
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value={"generated-url"}>
    1. Install ngrok on the machine with Pieces OS if it isn’t already
    2. Run the following command on your machine’s terminal: ```ngrok http 1000```
    3. Copy the forwarding URL it generates to use in the next step
  </TabItem>

## Setting up your Pieces VS Code extension
