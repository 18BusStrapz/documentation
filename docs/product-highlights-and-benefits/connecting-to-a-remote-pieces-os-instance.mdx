# Connecting to a Remote Pieces OS Instance

Through multiple user support tickets, we have noticed that many of our users are using the Pieces for Developers VS Code extension in a remote development environment.

This guide will walk you through how to connect to a remote Pieces OS instance using the Pieces for Developers VS Code extension.

> - This is currently only available for the Pieces for Developers VS Code extension. Functionality for the rest of the Pieces for Developers ecosystem is coming soon.

<Info>If Pieces OS is running on the same machine as VS Code, there should be no requirement to use this feature. Please verify these steps are required for your set up before following this guide. This custom URL is not the same thing as your Pieces Cloud custom url.</Info>

## Use Cases

- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)
- [SSH connection](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh)
- [Development Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)

## Prerequisites

- 1 machine with [Pieces OS](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) installed
- 1 machine with the [Pieces for Developers VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piecesapp.pieces) installed

## Getting Started

### Reverse Proxy Tunnel

> - In the case that Pieces OS shares the same LAN with your remote VS Code instance, you should use the LAN IP address of your machine and not ngrok.
> - [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download), or a similar alternative, must be installed on the machine with Pieces OS. It must be known that doing this will expose your Pieces OS endpoints to the public and this should only be done as a last resort.

We recommend using a static ngrok URL which you can claim by following [this guide](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/free-static-domains-ngrok-users).

<Tabs
  defaultValue={"static-url"}
  values={[
    {label: 'LAN IP Address', value: 'lan-ip-address'},
    {label: 'Static URL', value: 'static-url'},
    {label: 'Generated URL', value: 'generated-url'},
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="lan-ip-address">
    1. Ensure that there is not a firewall in place that will block connection between two machines on your LAN.
    2. Locate your machine's LAN IP address
      a. If possible, you should also set up a DHCP IP reservation for your machine running Pieces OS so this IP address will not change in the future.
    3. Your custom URL will be:
      a. Linux: `http://{'{LAN IP ADDRESS}'}:5323`
      b. MacOS or Windows: `http://{'{LAN IP ADDRESS}'}:1000`
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="static-url">
    1. Install ngrok on the machine with Pieces OS if it isn’t already
    2. Run the following command on your machine’s terminal: 
      a. (windows and macos)`ngrok http --domain=STATIC_URL_HERE 1000` 
      b. (linux)`ngrok http --domain=STATIC_URL_HERE 5323`
    3. Copy the forwarding URL it generates to use in the next step
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value={"generated-url"}>
    1. Install ngrok on the machine with Pieces OS if it isn’t already
    2. Run the following command on your machine’s terminal: (windows and macos)`ngrok http 1000` (linux)`ngrok http 5323`
    3. Copy the forwarding URL it generates to use in the next step
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Setting up your Pieces VS Code extension

Now we will set up your Pieces VS Code extension to connect to your machine with Pieces OS.

1. Open VS Code on your machine
2. Go to VS Code Settings `CMD/CTRL + ,`
3. Ensure that you have the `Workspace` tab selected
4. Search `pieces custom url`
5. Paste your ngrok forwarding URL in the input for `Pieces: Custom Url`

#### Reloading your VS Code window

Now we will reload your VS Code window to ensure that your Pieces VS Code extension is using your ngrok forwarding URL.

1. Open up the Command Palette `CMD/CTRL + Shift + P`
2. Search `Reload Window`
3. Select `Developer: Reload Window`

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

> - [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) must be installed and configured on your machine

This integration should work out of the box with WSL. If you are having trouble connecting, please see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for steps on how to set up an inbound firewall rule.

## Troubleshooting

### Pieces OS is not connecting on WSL

For WSL users, if the connection does not work automatically, you might have to set up an inbound firewall rule to allow the connection.

1. Open Windows Firewall: Press `Win + R`, search `firewall.cpl`, and press Enter.
2. In the left pane, click on `Advanced settings` to open the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.
3. In the left pane, click on `Inbound Rules`.
4. On the right pane, click on `New Rule`.
5. Rule Type: Select `Port` and click Next.
6. Protocol and Ports: Choose `TCP` and specify port number `1000`. Click Next.
7. Action: Select `Allow the connection` and click Next.
8. Profile: Choose Public, Private, and Domain for the profile.
9. Name: Give the rule a name like `Local Devices on Port 1000`, and click Finish.
