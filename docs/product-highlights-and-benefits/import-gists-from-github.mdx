Import saved code from GitHub with the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/overview">Pieces for Developers | Desktop App</a>. When you import Gists, Pieces attaches metadata from the original repo along with PRs, related people, and additional context.

## How to Import Gists into Pieces Desktop
Before proceeding to import gists from GitHub into Pieces, make sure that you are signed in, and
_if you are signed in to Google and GitHub, be sure that the **primary emails on both accounts match**._

To import the Gists and upgrade them:
1. **Press 'Add Snippets' > 'Import Gists'**
2. The Snippet Discovery Window will open **but don't worry** we use snippet discovery to enrich your snippets as you import them from GitHub, so they do not lose their context.
    -  [Learn more about origin details and other context](#)
3. Once you press "Select Gists" - in a similar way as [Snippet Discovery](#), you will be presented with a list of Snippets that have been discovered from your github account.
    - if you are not seeing you Gists, make sure they are set to public otherwise they will not be detected
4. Select the Gists that you want by pressing the checkbox to select each on individually, or by pressing "save all" in the top right
5. You will be brought back to your default view and then can see all the snippets that you just discovered inside your gists

### Gist Metadata
Each code snippet that you save as a Gist is packed full of metadata and information about the repository you saved it from. Traditionally when you save a Gist, its origin can be lost unless you take a lot of extra steps or click through dozens of pull requests and commits.

Some of the metadata that you may get when importing gists in Pieces Desktop are:
- related links to urls about the repo the code came from
- commit history included inside the description of the snippet
- resource documentation links for packages used in the config files
- other users that are included in the comments or pull request

### Where can I see this newly uncovered Data?
If you toggle to the [information view](#) you can find all the metadata that came through from GitHub that was previously difficult to see.
