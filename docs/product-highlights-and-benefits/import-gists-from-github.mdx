<Image zoom src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pfd_wiki/IMPORT_GIST.gif" />

Import saved code from GitHub with the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/overview">Pieces for Developers | Desktop App</a>. When you import Gists, Pieces attaches metadata from the original repo along with PRs, related people, and additional context.

## How to Import Gists into Pieces Desktop
Before proceeding to import Gists from GitHub into Pieces, make sure that you are signed in, and
_if you are signed in to Google and GitHub, be sure that the **primary emails on both accounts match**._

To import the Gists and upgrade them:
1. **Press 'Add Snippets' > 'Import Gists'**
2. The Snippet Discovery window will open, as we use our Snippet Discovery feature to [enrich your snippets](/features/auto-enrichment) as you import them from GitHub, so they do not lose their context. 
3. Once you press "Select Gists" - in a similar way as [Snippet Discovery](/product-highlights-and-benefits/in-project-snippet-discovery), you will be presented with a list of Snippets that have been discovered from your GitHub account.
    - if you are not seeing your Gists, make sure they are set to **public** otherwise they will not be detected
4. Select the Gists that you want to save by pressing the checkbox to select each one individually, or by pressing "save all" in the top right.
5. You will be brought back to your default view where you can see all of the snippets that you just discovered inside your Gists.


### Gist Metadata
Each code snippet that you save as a Gist is packed full of metadata and information about the repository you saved it from. Traditionally, when you save a Gist, it's origin woould be lost unless you take extra steps to click through dozens of pull requests and commits.

Some of the metadata that you may get when importing Gists into the Pieces Desktop App are:
- related links to URLs about the repo the code came from
- commit history included inside the description of the snippet
- resource documentation links for packages used in the config files
- other users that are included in the comments or pull request

### Where can I see this newly uncovered data?
If you toggle to the **Context View** you can [find all the metadata that came through from GitHub](/features/auto-enrichment), and edit it as you'd like.
