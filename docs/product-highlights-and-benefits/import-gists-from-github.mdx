# Import Gists from GitHub
Import saved code from GitHub with the <a href="{{ links.website.home }}">Pieces for Developers | Desktop App</a>. When you import Gists, Pieces attaches metadata from its original repo along with PRs, related people, and additional context.

## Metadata Inside of Gists
Each code snippet that you save as a Gist is packed full of metadata and information about the repository you saved it from. Traditionally when you save a gist, the location it came from can be lost without a lot of extra steps or clicking through pull requests and commits. But when you import the gists that you have already created, more metadata that was previously hidden can be found inside the Information View inside of Pieces for Developers.
