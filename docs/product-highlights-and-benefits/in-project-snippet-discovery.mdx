- ### In-Project Snippet Discovery
[Pieces for Developers]( {{links.website.home}} ) is the first developer tool in the world to ingest an entire code base and return hyper-specific, highly-reusable code snippets entirely offline and on-device.
Running **[Snippet Discovery]** on a local source repository has huge benefits:
  - Discover highly reusable snippets, resulting in less time spent re-writing the same code from scratch over and over
  - Driving code standardization within and across projects
  - Discover reference snippets and share them with your team or use them to onboard new developers faster than ever
