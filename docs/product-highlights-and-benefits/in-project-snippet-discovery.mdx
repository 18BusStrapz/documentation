<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/overview">Pieces for Developers</a> is the first developer tool in the world to ingest an entire code base and return hyper-specific, highly reusable code snippets entirely offline and on-device.

## What is Snippet Discovery?
Snippet Discovery allows you to create code snippets from the code you have already written in a specific project, directory, or file. This automated process is useful when:
- **Getting Started with Pieces Desktop and you have no snippets**
- **Onboarding into a new project** and wanting to get some of the most useful snippets in the Repo
- Forking a repository and wanting any reference docs mentioned or related to the project
- and many other cases!

## Running Snippet Discovery
To run Snippet Discovery, you will need to follow these instructions here:
1. **Press _Add Snippets_ > _Snippet Discovery_**
2. **Select Files**:
    - This allows for selecting a single or multiple files. Once the [File Picker](product-highlights-and-benefits/saving-useful-developer-materials#pieces-desktop) opens, select a single file and press 'open' or hold ``` cmd/ctrl ``` while you select multiple files

3. **Select a Folder**:
    - When selecting a folder, you can only select one at a time. Since there is an unknown number of files it is best to select the directory closest to the code that you use
    - For Example: instead of using a ` /lib/widgets ` or ` /src/views `, it may be better to use the non nested ` /lib ` or ` /src ` to attach more holistic context

4. **Select Gists**:
    - Selecting Gists _requires_ you to be signed in. If you are not signed in when you select this option, you will receive a notification to sign in.
    - We use this to connect your GitHub Account to your Pieces Account.

5. **Drag and Drop**:
 - When you drag code into Pieces Desktop while on the list or gallery view, it will be added as a single asset. **But if you drag an entire file or directory into Pieces Desktop while Snippet Discovery is open, it will perform snippet discovery on the file or directory you just added.**

## Why should you run Snippet Discovery?
Running **Snippet Discovery** on a local source repository has huge benefits:
  - Discover highly reusable snippets, resulting in less time spent rewriting the same code from scratch over and over
  - Drive code standardization within and across projects
  - Discover reference snippets and share them with your team or use them to onboard new developers faster than ever
