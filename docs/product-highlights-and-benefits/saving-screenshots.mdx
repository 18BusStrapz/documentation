- ### Saving Screenshots and Optical Code Recognition
To save an image or screenshot, you can either drag the image directly into the [Flagship Desktop App] window or you can _upload a file_ by clicking the "Add +" button above the icons in the carousel.
- Any file type that Pieces for Developers supports can be dragged or copied into the desktop app. Simply drag the file over the Pieces Desktop App and a green plus will appear. Drop the file into the application window; it will be added to the repo immediately.
> If your file is too large, you can compress the image via the notification that appears when you release your mouse click.
