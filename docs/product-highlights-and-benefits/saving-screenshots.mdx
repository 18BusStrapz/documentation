# Saving Screenshots and Optical Code Recognition

## Why Would I need a Screenshot of Code?
Sometimes the code you need is not in a location where it can be copied, - such as in YouTube videos, tutorials, onboarding docs, or messages. **You can capture this code, modify and manipulate it as you wish** by taking a screenshot using ``` cmd + shift + 4 ``` or ``` windowskey + shift + S ```.

### Adding a Screenshot via "Add a File"

You can quickly add a screenshot using the File Picker by pressing ``` cmd + u ``` or ``` ctrl + U ``` which will bring up the Native File browser window based on your OS.

To add an image from a specific file location, you can follow these steps:
- **Press _+ Add Snippets_** to open the **Add Code Snippets & Developer Material Layouts** dialog
- Select **Add a file**
- Once the File Picker opens, you can select an image file, and it will be added to as a resource to Pieces Desktop and any extensions or plugins you have installed.

Note: You can drag the image directly from
- macOS quick preview of a screenshot that appears in the bottom corner
- [Windows Snipping Tool Preview](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b) attaches the code block to your clipboard, or you can click the screenshot and select the copy button to copy and paste the snippet into Pieces Desktop.

### Getting Code Out of a Screenshot
To get the code out of a screenshot, all you have to do is press the ``` { } ``` icon that is located in the Action Menu on the right side of the application.

This will show you a few things:
- First, you now can edit the code snippet if there are any inconsistencies.
- You can also see related links, tags, and other data that was enriched from the code inside the image.
