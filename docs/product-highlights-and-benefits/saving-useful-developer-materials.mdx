# Saving Useful Developer Materials
![Icons that indicate the materials that can be saved in Pieces.](https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/vs_code_marketplace/GIFs/MATERIAL_TYPES)

Pieces for Developers was built from the ground up to serve as a centralized place to save all types of materials and resources related to a developer's work-in-progress journey.
Code snippets, scratch files,  screenshots, UML diagrams, links, and more. Paste something from your clipboard, drag & drop, or save it directly in IDE via our plugins.

## Stay in Flow with Effortless Save
We are making a continuous effort to provide our users with frictionless ways to save key workflow materials. Stay in flow with our <a href="{{ links.website.home }}">Flagship Desktop App</a> and simply copy a code snippet or other resource and paste it in Pieces. You can also drag images, files, and more directly into the desktop app. Save all types of resources. It's better to have a resource available and not need it than need it and not have it!

_e.g., Boilerplate/Reference Snippets, Common Bash/Powershell Commands, CI/CD Configurations, HTTP Requests, Screenshots, Architecture/UML Diagrams, Text Notes, and so much more._
