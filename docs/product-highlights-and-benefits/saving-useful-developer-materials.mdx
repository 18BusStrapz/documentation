# Save Useful Developer Materials

<Image zoom src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pfd_wiki/DROP_A_FILE.gif" />

You can **save** a number of developer materials into Pieces for Developers, all by dragging, via right click, file picker, and even cool features like auto-save.

Here's our list of Supported Materials:
- Images (.png, .jpeg, .jpg, and [more](#) )
    - [Learn more about Importing Screenshots](#)
- Raw Text or Code
- Whole Files
    - (if you want to import a directory and use Snippet Discovery, Pieces will discover Materials for you)
- GitHub Gists, imported through Snippet Discovery
- Are there More?

## Ways to Add Materials to Pieces
When using Pieces for Developers - whether it be inside the Desktop App or one of our Plugins (See the [Microsoft Teams App](#)) - there are lots of ways to save Developer Materials. They can be seperated into _Universal_ and _Specific_ as follows:

### Universal:
- Right click and select "Save to Pieces" in your context menu, the snippet will be added with metadata to Pieces Desktop

### Specific:

#### Pieces Desktop:
- Drag & Drop a file or Image over top of Pieces Desktop to save the contents as a new resource
- Via Snippet Discovery
    1. **Press 'Add Snippets' > 'Snippet Discovery'**
    2. **Select Files**:
        - This allows for selecting a single or multiple files. Once the [File Picker](#) opens, select a single file and press 'open' or hold ```cmd/ctrl``` while you select each file
    3. **Select a Folder**:
        - When selecting a folder, you can only select one at a time. Since there is an unknown number of files it is best to select the directory closest to the code that you use
        - For Example: instead of using a /lib/widgets or /src/views, it may be better to use the non nested /lib or /src to attach more holistic context
    4. **Select Gists**:
        - Selecting Gists _requires_ you to be signed in. If you are not signed in when you select this option, you will receive a notification to sign in.
            - We use this to connect your GitHub Account to your Pieces Account.

    5. **Drag and Drop**:
        - When you drag code into Pieces Desktop while on the list or gallery view, it will be added as a single asset. **But if you drag an entire file or directory into Pieces Desktop while Snippet Discovery is open, it will perform snippet discovery on the file or directory you just added.**

#### Jetbrains Plugin:
- Drag Code Directly into Pieces for JetBrains in the sidebar and a resource will be created
- Use ```option+shift+P``` or ```alt+shift+P``` with code selected to save a new resource

#### VSCode Extension:
- Use ```command+shift+V``` or ```windows key+shift+V``` with code selected to save a new resource

#### Chrome Extension:
- Press the 'Copy & Save' button that appears when you hover any code block
    - Our code block detection inside of Pieces Chrome Extension depends on the html style of the codeblocks on the page. We detect ```<pre>``` tags and ```<code>``` tags to capture code and insert buttons to save and share
    - Learn more about [Sharing and the Share button](#) that appears next to 'Copy & Save'
- Use ```cmd+shift+s``` to save text or code from a website

## Stay in Flow with Effortless Save
We are making a continuous effort to provide our users with frictionless ways to save key workflow materials. Stay in flow with our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/overview">Flagship Desktop App</a> and simply copy a code snippet or other resource and paste it into Pieces. You can also drag images, files, and more directly into the desktop app. Save all types of resources. It's better to have a resource and not need it than to need it and not have it!
